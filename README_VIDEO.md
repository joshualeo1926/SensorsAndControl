# 41014 - Sensors & Control

### Video Summary
This video was made to showcase our learning over the course of the Sensors & Control final assessment. The video outlines all the key learning outcomes that result in a simulated fetch robot successfully following a guided marker, whilst responding to collisions as required.

### Learning Outcomes
We believe we have learned and implemented the following Sensors & Control techniques successfully:
- Understanding of ROS topics, subscriber & publisher nodes, ROS framework and implementation with MATLAB.
- Understanding of the Gazebo simulation environment
- Understanding of the sensing capabilities of the Fetch robot, and how to implement them in a simulated environment.
- Implementation of computer vision techniques (SURF detection & feature recognition, camera image co-ordinate frame manipulation, localisation using robot camera).
- Understanding sensor data and processing sensor data in MATLAB.
- Control techniques for Robot manipulation (PID).
- Communication between MATLAB & Gazebo via ROS on Ubuntu.
- Implementing a closed-loop control system.
- 3D object construction & manipulation in the Gazebo simulation environment.
